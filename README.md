# Corydalis

â€¦ is a simple application to help manage offline (as in non-cloud)
collections of RAW and processed pictures. I wrote it as I'm not able
to keep post-processing up with the amount of RAW pictures I take;
additionally there is a lot of cruft accumulating over time. Corydalis
should be mostly independent of the actual file types and the program
used to process the raw files, although maybe I do make some
assumptions and I'm just not aware of it; its only requirement is that
ImageMagick (used to generate the downscaled images for web viewing)
supports the "processed" image format (which in the vast majority of
cases will be JPEG, so the point is moot).

See the `INSTALL.md` file for how to quickly run and see Corydalis'
output; the application only writes to its own `static/tmp` directory
and the 'cachedir' directory as specified in the configuration
files. Pointing that key to an initially empty directory ensures that
it will not clobber anything.

The application itself is a web server - the allowed users are stored
in an sqlite database in the `db/` directory - and is designed to be
run close or on the machine that hosts the files (walking the file
system over NFS or Samba will a long time); it can be run directly on
the NAS if it's a Linux machine.

Once started, navigate to the host/port setup in the configuration
file, and explore the classification of folders. Note that not all
organisation of files/folders is supported, see the `MANUAL.md` file.

## Features

* file-type independent (customisable extensions for raw files,
  processed files, sidecar files, etc.); this might change in the
  future if exif metadata reading support is added
* independent of the program that edits the files
* tracks files also for panorama/HDR outputs (multiple raw files
  combined into a single output file)
* computes list of unprocessed files, orphan sidecar files, etc.
* view the output/processed files, with navigation facilities allowing
  the browsing of the entire collection (requires a recent browser
  with HTML5 support; tested on Firefox, Chrome and partially Safari)
